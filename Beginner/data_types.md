# Built-in Data Types
## Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
## Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

| Data Type    | Variable Type | 
| :-------- | :------- | 
| Text Type     | str      |
| Numeric Types | int, float, complex |
| Sequence Types | list, tuple, range |
| Mapping Type | dict |
| Set Types | set, frozenset |
| Boolean Type | bool |
| Binary Types | bytes, bytearray, memoryview |
| None Type | NoneType |

## Getting the Data Type
### we can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:

```python
x = 16
print(type(x))
# Output: <class 'int'>
```

## Setting the Data Type
### In Python, the data type is set when we assign a value to a variable:

## Setting the Specific Data Type
### If we want to specify the data type, we can use the following constructor functions:

```python
x = str("Hello World") # str
```
